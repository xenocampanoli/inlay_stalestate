		<h5>Early Linux Experience</h5>
		<p>First experiences with Linux began in 1993, and after 1994 I always have had a Linux system in my home.  Through most of the 90s I was used to compiling my own kernels (I was already
		a Unix C programmer at that time).  Linux flavors I've worked on over the years include:  Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOS, openSuSE, Fedora, Slackware, Mandrake, Gentoo.  I have also used BSD, Sys5, Solaris, Ultrix, Vax/VMS, AIX, qnx, TOPS-10, Perkin-Elmer OS/32.</p>
